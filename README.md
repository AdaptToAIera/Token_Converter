## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Serve the files:** PWAs, especially those with Service Workers, need to be served over HTTP(S). You can use a simple local web server for testing.
    * **Using Python:** If you have Python installed, run `python -m http.server` in the project directory.
    * **Using Node.js:** If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx serve` (install with `npm install -g serve` if needed).
    * **Other Options:** Many IDEs (like VS Code with extensions) or tools provide built-in web servers.
3.  **Open in browser:** Navigate to the address provided by your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
